I sold my first software distribution to the public over 30 years ago.

The CDs I sold were based on open blueprints I downloaded for free from the internet.

I walked around the "First Saturday" hacker's market held under a highway overpass yelling: "Free Software, $5!"

Sometimes folks would come up and whisper (do you have any Microsoft Windows?), to which I'd reply:

Bill hasen't give permission distribute or modify his software.
However Linus and Richard encourage me to modify and pass on their blueprints without asking permission.

I was able to make about $300 that weekend.

Under a bridge and in a parking lot? That's sketchy enough right there. Nowadays a good portion of the sale takes place at night because, according to the sidewalk sale's Web site, that is when the best "deals" often take place. Let's see, computer shopping at night to get the best "deals"? This just gets better and better. What's funny though, is that these guys love what they do and, as offended as they may pretend to be, they all probably like being called computer geeks when they are trying to sell the best "deal" of the night under a bridge.

#+begin_notes
Everyone in this room has used software from the these Foundations.

My mentor Dan Kohn, created the Open Heath Foundation to help public health authorities use open source software to fight COVID-19. He helped coordinate Google and Apple to create the exposure framework used by most of the world. I'm proud to say that code is used within New Zealand's COVID tracing app, which is also open source.

Earlier this year, they worked with the US Government to help create an Open Programmable and Secure 5G End to End stack.

There is too much loss of productivity and innovation due to the absence of re-usable tools and data.

I think New Zealand is well placed to go further, together by curating local talent connected to the global ecosystem of innovation.

It's the reason I've spent the last 10 years of my life in New Zealand.

#+begin_notes
I'm most proud of my success mentoring and teaching local youth to be leaders and engage directly with the IT communities in which we serve.

Many of them traveling or speaking internationally on advanced research topics as teenagers.


Our youth today are inherently 'cloud native' from an early age, and the desire for 'beyond us' impact and engament might surprise us if we give them a chance.

If we are going to have council employees in the next ten years that can onboard our community to these resources, we need to start now.

If our students can be on-ramped to active participation in the open source culture of inclusion, transparency, and governance, they will be well prepared to lead these types of initiatives locally.

This is a philisophical statement that will take about 10 minutes to read.

One of the first things we learn in a healthy community is trust, and I trust what you have said, that you will read this. It is important to me. I care deeply about transparency and inclusion in our community.

If we are spending public money, we should have public blueprints.
